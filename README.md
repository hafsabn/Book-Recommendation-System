# Books Recommendation System

This project demonstrates an **unsupervised machine learning approach** to building a book recommendation system. The system uses frequent pattern mining algorithms to analyze and identify relationships in the dataset and generate recommendations. A web interface is provided for users to input a book and receive recommendations based on it.

## Overview
This project is a **books recommendation system** that suggests books to users based on patterns derived from a dataset of user ratings. It leverages frequent pattern mining algorithms, specifically **Eclat**, **Apriori**, and **FP-Growth**, to uncover associations between books.

A **web interface** allows users to input a book and receive recommendations generated by the FP-Growth model. The recommendations are based on the most frequent patterns discovered in the dataset.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project consists of two files:
1. **Books**: Contains metadata about books, including:
   - ISBN
   - Book title
   - Author
   - Year of publication
   - Publisher
   - Image URL (Small, mediam, large)
2. **Ratings**: Contains user interaction data:
   - User ID
   - ISBN of the book
   - Book rating (0–10 scale)

After cleaning the data:
- The final dataset includes the following columns:
  - User ID
  - ISBN
  - Book rating
  - Book title

## Approach and Algorithms
The recommendation system explores frequent patterns in user ratings using:
1. **Eclat Algorithm**
2. **Apriori Algorithm**
3. **FP-Growth Algorithm**

The **FP-Growth Algorithm** produced the best results, as it efficiently handled large datasets and provided meaningful book association rules.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Removed duplicate and missing entries.
   - Merged `Books` and `Ratings` datasets into a single CSV file.
   - Ensured consistent formatting.

2. **Frequent Pattern Mining**:
   - Tested **Eclat**, **Apriori**, and **FP-Growth** on the dataset.
   - Evaluated each algorithm based on computational efficiency and meaningful recommendations.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Selected the **FP-Growth Algorithm** for its superior performance.

4. **Web Interface**:
   - Developed a simple web interface where users can input a book title.
   - The system returns book recommendations based on the input.

---

## Results
- **Frequent itemsets**: Discovered frequent combinations of books rated by users.
- **Recommendations**: Generated book suggestions based on association rules derived using the **FP-Growth Algorithm**.
**Web Interface**: Functional interface to provide recommendations interactively.

---

## Technologies Used
The following technologies were used to develop the project:

- **Python**: The core programming language for data processing and algorithm implementation.
- **Pandas**: For data cleaning, preprocessing, and manipulation.
- **Mlxtend**: Library providing implementation of the FP-Growth algorithm and association rules.
- **Flask**: Web framework used to create the user interface for inputting books and displaying recommendations.
- **HTML/CSS**: To design and style the web interface.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Used during the exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase for visualizing and understanding the data.

## Future Work
Here are the potential future improvements and extensions to the project:

1. **Transition to Streamlit**:
   - Replace Flask with Streamlit to provide a more interactive and visually appealing user interface.
   - Integrate Streamlit’s features to improve user experience and interactivity.

2. **MLOps Integration**:
   - Develop the project as an MLOps pipeline.
   - Automate data ingestion, model training, deployment, and monitoring
